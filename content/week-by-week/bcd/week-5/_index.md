# Week 5: Web Development — Advanced

This week dives deeper into web application architecture. You will learn about three-tier architecture, database integration, and environment-specific configuration.

## Theory

- Three-tier architecture: presentation, business logic, and data layers
- Database integration and configuration management

## Practice

Build a layered web application:

- [Webapp Development — Service Layer](/exercises/webapp-development/service-layer/) - Implement service layer and unit tests
- [Webapp Development — Data Layer](/exercises/webapp-development/data-layer/) - Repository pattern, MongoDB, and CosmosDB integration

## Preparation

- Read up on three-tier architecture and databases

## Reflection Questions

- What is a three-tier architecture?
- How is configuration managed across different environments?
- Why do you separate presentation, logic, and data?
