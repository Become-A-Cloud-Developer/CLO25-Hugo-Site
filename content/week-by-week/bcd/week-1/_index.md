# Week 1: Virtual Servers

This week introduces cloud computing and virtual servers. You will create an Azure account, provision your first virtual machine, and learn to connect via SSH.

## Theory

Understand the concepts behind compute infrastructure:

- [Intro to Cloud Development](/intro-cloud-development/) - What cloud computing is, service models, and deployment models
- [Compute](/infrastructure-fundamentals/compute/) - What servers are, server roles, and how physical and virtual servers work

## Practice

Provision and manage virtual machines in Azure:

- [Server Foundation Exercises](/exercises/server-foundation/) - From portal-based VM creation to command-line automation

## Preparation

- Create a Microsoft Azure account

## Reflection Questions

- What is a virtual server?
- What is Linux and how does it differ from Windows?
- How can you interact with a virtual server in the cloud via SSH?
