# Week 2: Infrastructure as Code

This week focuses on automating infrastructure provisioning. You will learn about Infrastructure as Code and use ARM templates, Bicep, and cloud-init to automate VM deployment.

## Theory

Understand the concepts behind Infrastructure as Code:

- [Infrastructure as Code](/infrastructure-fundamentals/infrastructure-as-code/) - What IaC is, ARM templates, and Bicep

## Practice

Automate infrastructure provisioning:

- [Server Foundation — Command Line Interface](/exercises/server-foundation/command-line-interface/) - Creating resources with AZ CLI and bash scripts
- [Server Foundation — ARM and Bicep](/exercises/server-foundation/arm-and-bicep/) - ARM templates, Bicep, and cloud-init automation

## Preparation

- Read up on Infrastructure as Code

## Reflection Questions

- How can you use IaC to create a virtual server?
- What is cloud-init?
- What advantages does IaC provide compared to manual configuration?
