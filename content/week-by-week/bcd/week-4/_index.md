# Week 4: Virtual Networks

This week covers virtual networking in Azure. You will learn about network security groups, application security groups, bastion hosts, and reverse proxies.

## Theory

Understand the concepts behind network infrastructure:

- [Network](/infrastructure-fundamentals/network/) - IP addresses, CIDR ranges, firewalls, and network architecture

## Practice

Build and secure virtual networks:

- [Network Foundation Exercises](/exercises/network-foundation/) - From portal-based VNet creation to command-line automation

## Preparation

- Read up on virtual networks in Microsoft Azure

## Reflection Questions

- What is a virtual network?
- Why do you use a bastion host?
- What does a reverse proxy do?
