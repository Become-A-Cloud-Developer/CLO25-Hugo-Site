# Cloud Databases

Learn to provision and use Azure cloud data services through progressive exercises, from visual portal interface to infrastructure as code and application integration.

## Learning Path

This track guides you through managed data service provisioning and usage using five complementary approaches:

1. **Portal Interface** - Graphical approach for understanding CosmosDB resources and configuration visually
2. **Command Line Interface** - Scriptable approach for database provisioning automation and repeatability
3. **ARM and Bicep** - Infrastructure as Code approach for declarative, version-controlled database deployments
4. **Connecting from Code** - Application integration with a .NET proof-of-concept
5. **Azure Blob Storage** - Provisioning cloud storage for serving static assets like images
