A good tutorial is focused, practical, and easy to follow. Before writing, decide exactly what the reader will accomplish by the end and what prior knowledge you expect them to have. Keep the scope narrow — one task, one outcome.

## Structure

Every tutorial should follow this structure:

### Goal

State what the reader will achieve in one or two sentences. Be specific about the end result.

### Prerequisites

List what the reader needs before starting:

- Required knowledge or skills
- Tools and software to install
- Accounts, subscriptions, or access rights

### Steps

Break the task into numbered steps. Each step should do one thing. Include code snippets or commands where applicable, and explain *why* a step is needed when the reason is not obvious.

Use tips and warnings sparingly to highlight common mistakes or important details.

### Verification

Describe how the reader can confirm that the tutorial worked. Show the expected output or result so they know they are on the right track.

### Cleanup

Explain how to remove or tear down any resources created during the tutorial. This is especially important for cloud resources that incur costs.

## Writing Tips

- Use clear, direct language. Avoid jargon, or define it on first use.
- Be consistent with terminology, command formatting, and naming.
- Use code blocks with syntax highlighting for all commands and configuration.
- Include only what the reader needs to complete the task. Cut everything else.
- Add diagrams or screenshots when they clarify something that text alone cannot.

## Before You Publish

Walk through the entire tutorial yourself, step by step, in a clean environment. If a step is confusing or fails, fix it. A tutorial that does not work is worse than no tutorial at all.
