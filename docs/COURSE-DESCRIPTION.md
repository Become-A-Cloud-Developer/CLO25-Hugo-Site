# Basic Cloud Applications, 50 YH credits

## Course Description

This course provides the student with a foundational understanding of how modern cloud applications are developed and deployed. The course introduces cloud platforms, their service models, and the central building blocks of a web-based application such as the client-server model, three-tier architecture, and common design patterns.

The course provides familiarity with Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), then focuses on development and infrastructure in Azure.

Students develop a simple application and gain practical experience deploying it to the cloud. The course covers how applications are configured for different environments, version control and CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions, and how secrets and identities are handled securely.

The goal is for students to understand how cloud-based applications are developed, configured, and deployed at a foundational level, creating a stable base for subsequent courses on architecture, cloud operations, and scalable solutions.

## Assessment Criteria

The course is examined through **written assignments** (3) with accompanying documentation and reports.

For a passing grade (G) on the course, G is required on all objectives examined through written assignments.

For distinction (VG) on the course, G is required on all objectives plus VG on objectives that have this criterion. Assessment of the student's knowledge and skills is made in relation to learning objectives. It is the student's responsibility to submit assignments on time.

- **Pass (Godkänt):** G required on all components
- **Distinction (Väl godkänt):** G + VG required on all components

## Learning Objectives

### Knowledge

| Objective | Pass (G) | Distinction (VG) | Assignment |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Explain cloud platform service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and basic concepts in cloud development and operations | Achieved | — | **1** |
| Describe the client-server model, three-tier architecture, and common design patterns such as MVC, Dependency Injection, and Repository Pattern | Achieved | — | **1, 2** |
| Explain the principles behind DevOps and basic version control and CI/CD workflows | Achieved | — | **3** |
| Explain secure handling of secrets, identities, and access control in cloud environments | Achieved | — | **3** |
| Describe the basics of logging and monitoring of applications in the cloud | Achieved | — | **3** |

### Skills

| Objective | Pass (G) | Distinction (VG) | Assignment |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Develop and deploy a simple application on a cloud platform and configure its basic resources | Achieved | Deploys and manages the application independently and in a structured manner, with cleaner configuration and fewer manual steps so the solution is more stable and easier to reproduce | **1, 2** |
| Use Git and create a basic CI/CD workflow for automated deployment | Achieved | Creates a CI/CD workflow that is independently developed, clearly structured, and minimizes manual steps during deployment | **3** |
| Perform basic system administration in portal and CLI and carry out simple troubleshooting of deployment issues | Achieved | Troubleshoots independently and methodically, demonstrated through clear and correct commands or configurations that resolve the issue | **1, 2, 3** |
| Handle secrets and identities securely when deploying applications | Achieved | Handles secrets and identities independently in a manner that follows good security practices | **3** |
| Use logging and monitoring tools to identify causes of simple errors and verify that the application runs correctly | Achieved | — | **3** |

### Competence

| Objective | Pass (G) | Distinction (VG) | Assignment |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Independently develop, deploy, and troubleshoot simple cloud applications following established practices and DevOps principles | Achieved | Carries out development, deployment, and troubleshooting independently and with clear structure, so the process can be reproduced without unnecessary manual steps | **1, 2, 3** |
| Use appropriate basic cloud services and tools and apply good security principles when handling secrets and identities | Achieved | Uses cloud services and security solutions in a way that produces a stable, clean, and clearly organized solution | **1, 2, 3** |
